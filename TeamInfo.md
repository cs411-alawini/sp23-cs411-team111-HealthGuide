## Project Summary

Our team will be developing a web application where users can enter their symptoms and determine the illness and severity of their symptoms. The app is similar to a few other applications online (Ada, Mayo Clinic), that use symptoms to identify illness. Our application is different in that it aims to show illness data in a more general way and uses factors other than just symptoms (ex: map of illness distribution, illness search page, etc.). Users will be able to create accounts where they can post about their illness and have others answer questions. The goal is to have people who have suffered from an illness help other people who suffer from the same illness.
